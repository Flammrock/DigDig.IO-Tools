## Description

**DigDig.IO Map Scanner Tiny Viewer** is a simplified version of the **DigDig.IO Map Scanner Viewer**. It serves a similar purpose: to visualize maps from the game [DigDig.IO](https://digdig.io/). However, this project is designed to be lightweight and stripped-down, with fewer features and is close to being deprecated.

This viewer uses the `canvas` npm package and the `@kmamal/sdl` npm package to render the map chunks in real-time. While it retains the core functionality of displaying scanned map data, it does not include the extensive features available in the full **DigDig.IO Map Scanner Viewer**.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone
```

**Note:** The following should be done at the project root.

2. Install NPM packages
```
npm install
```
3. Build the tiny viewer
```
npm run build:map-scanner-tiny-viewer
```
4. Start the tiny viewer
```
npm run start:map-scanner-tiny-viewer
```

## Note

This project is considered close to deprecation. For a more feature-rich experience, please refer to the **DigDig.IO Map Scanner Viewer**.
